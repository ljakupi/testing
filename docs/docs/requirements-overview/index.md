# Requirements Overview

This section provides a comprehensive overview of all requirements that drive the solution architecture. Requirements are categorized into functional and non-functional requirements to ensure complete coverage of system capabilities and quality attributes.

## Overview

The requirements outlined in this section form the foundation for all architectural decisions and design choices. They have been gathered through:

- Stakeholder interviews and workshops
- Business analysis and process modeling
- Technical feasibility studies
- Regulatory and compliance reviews
- Industry best practices and standards

## Requirement Categories

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define what the system must do - the specific behaviors, functions, and features that the application must provide to meet business needs.

[See detailed functional requirements →](./functional-requirements.md)

### Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements define how the system should perform - the quality attributes, constraints, and performance characteristics that the system must exhibit.

[See detailed non-functional requirements →](./non-functional-requirements.md)

## Requirements Traceability

All requirements are tracked and traced throughout the development lifecycle:

- **Requirement ID:** Each requirement has a unique identifier
- **Priority:** Requirements are prioritized (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have)
- **Status:** Current state of requirement implementation
- **Verification:** How the requirement will be validated

## Requirements Management

### Change Control

All changes to requirements follow a formal change control process:

1. Change request submission
2. Impact analysis
3. Stakeholder review and approval
4. Documentation update
5. Communication to affected teams

### Validation and Verification

Requirements are validated through:

- Stakeholder review and sign-off
- Prototype demonstrations
- User acceptance testing
- Technical feasibility analysis

## Requirement Dependencies

Key dependencies between requirements are identified and managed:

- **Technical Dependencies:** Requirements that depend on specific technologies or platforms
- **Business Dependencies:** Requirements that depend on business processes or rules
- **Sequential Dependencies:** Requirements that must be implemented in a specific order
